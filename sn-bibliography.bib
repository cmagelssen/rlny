	abstract = {Scientific understanding of the contextual interference effect stems mainly from studies on unskilled participants learning artificial laboratory tasks. Although one goal of such studies is to extrapolate the findings to include real-world learning situations such as sports, this generalization is not straightforward. This study tested the contextual interference effect with 66 sub-elite, competitive alpine ski racers who learned a new movement pattern-the pumping technique to increase velocity in slalom-by practicing this skill in three different slalom courses over a 3-day training period. The interleaved group practiced all three courses each day in a semi-random order. In contrast, the blocked group practiced only one course each day, which was randomized and counterbalanced across the participants in this group. A retention test was delivered 72 h after the last practice day. In contrast to our hypothesis, the interleaved group did not display significantly better retention than the blocked group. The interleaved group's performance was also not significantly attenuated during skill learning compared to the blocked group. Our results underscore the importance of conducting motor learning experiments in natural environments to understand the conditions that facilitate learning beyond the laboratory environment.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

While the principle of the energy transfer from the vertical movement to the horizontal movement is well understood, the question of how to achieve the optimal energy transfer is still unresolved. In this paper, we introduce an inverse pendulum model to describe the movement of the center of mass of an athlete performing energy pumping. On this basis, the problem of identifying the optimal movement pattern is formulated as an optimal control problem. We solve the discretized optimal control problem with the help of a SQP-algorithm. We uncover that the optimal movement pattern consists of a jumping, flying, and landing phase, which has to be timed precisely. We investigate how the maximal horizontal speed depends on parameters like rollers height and maximal normal force of the athlete. Additionally, we present a qualitative comparison of our results with measured results from BMX-racing. For athletes and coaches, we advice on the basis of our results that athlete\&rsquo;s performance is optimized by using maximal force and adopt an exact and proper timing of the movement pattern.},

	abstract = {Understanding the biomechanics of Alpine skiing is fundamental to the design of training protocols, to identify the metabolic burden of athletes and to help preventing traumas. Despite the apparent simplicity of the overall mechanics related to a descent with skiis, the scientific community is still uncertain about the role of muscle contraction in controlling the trajectory on the snow and about the partitioning between force and skill in determining the performance outcome. Generally speaking, skiers increase their body energy (in terms of potential energy) by taking the cable car up to the mountain top; then, to reach the bottom of the track, all that energy needs to be dissipated (as heat). There are just three dissipators involved: snow, air and muscles. If muscles play a major role in transforming potential energy into heat, they need to contract eccentrically, and athletes should be mostly trained in that respect. Conversely, if snow (and its displacement) is responsible for most of the slowdown of the skier, it would be advisable for racers to be trained to generate force both concentrically and eccentrically, with a deeper focus on controlling the fast and intense alternation of the two muscle conditions (a sort of ‘intensively perturbed isometric contraction’). This chapter starts from constraints from physics and, through experimental data, tries to shed light on this, still debated topic.},

Besides relying heavily on sensory and reinforcement feedback, motor skill learning may also depend on the level of motivation experienced during training. Yet, how motivation by reward modulates motor learning remains unclear. In 90 healthy subjects, we investigated the net effect of motivation by reward on motor learning while controlling for the sensory and reinforcement feedback received by the participants. Reward improved motor skill learning beyond performance-based reinforcement feedback. Importantly, the beneficial effect of reward involved a specific potentiation of reinforcement-related adjustments in motor commands, which concerned primarily the most relevant motor component for task success and persisted on the following day in the absence of reward. We propose that the long-lasting effects of motivation on motor learning may entail a form of associative learning resulting from the repetitive pairing of the reinforcement feedback and reward during training, a mechanism that may be exploited in future rehabilitation protocols.},

	abstract = {Reward has a remarkable ability to invigorate motor behavior, enabling individuals to select and execute actions with greater precision and speed. However, if reward is to be exploited in applied settings, such as rehabilitation, a thorough understanding of its underlying mechanisms is required. In a series of experiments, we first demonstrate that reward simultaneously improves the selection and execution components of a reaching movement. Specifically, reward promoted the selection of the correct action in the presence of distractors, while also improving execution through increased speed and maintenance of accuracy. These results led to a shift in the speed-accuracy functions for both selection and execution. In addition, punishment had a similar impact on action selection and execution, although it enhanced execution performance across all trials within a block, that is, its impact was noncontingent to trial value. Although the reward-driven enhancement of movement execution has been proposed to occur through enhanced feedback control, an untested possibility is that it is also driven by increased arm stiffness, an energy-consuming process that enhances limb stability. Computational analysis revealed that reward led to both an increase in feedback correction in the middle of the movement and a reduction in motor noise near the target. In line with our hypothesis, we provide novel evidence that this noise reduction is driven by a reward-dependent increase in arm stiffness. Therefore, reward drives multiple error-reduction mechanisms which enable individuals to invigorate motor performance without compromising accuracy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT While reward is well-known for enhancing motor performance, how the nervous system generates these improvements is unclear. Despite recent work indicating that reward leads to enhanced feedback control, an untested possibility is that it also increases arm stiffness. We demonstrate that reward simultaneously improves the selection and execution components of a reaching movement. Furthermore, we show that punishment has a similar positive impact on performance. Importantly, by combining computational and biomechanical approaches, we show that reward leads to both improved feedback correction and an increase in stiffness. Therefore, reward drives multiple error-reduction mechanisms which enable individuals to invigorate performance without compromising accuracy. This work suggests that stiffness control plays a vital, and underappreciated, role in the reward-based imporvemenets in motor control.},

	abstract = {In this study on skill acquisition in a computerized throwing task, we examined the effect of graded correct-related performance feedback on the reward positivity of the event-related brain potential (ERP). Theories of reinforcement learning predict effects of reward magnitude and expectancy on the reward prediction error. The later is supposed to be reflected in reward positivity, a fronto-central ERP component. A sample of 68 participants learned to throw at a beamer-projected target disk while performance accuracy, displayed as the place of impact of the projectile on the target, served as graded feedback. Effects of performance accuracy in successful trials, hit frequency, and preceding trial performance on reward positivity were analyzed simultaneously on a trial-by-trial basis by means of linear mixed models. In accord with previous findings, reward positivity increased with feedback about more accurate performance. This relationship was not linear, but cubic, with larger impact of feedback towards the end of the accuracy distribution. In line with being a measure of expectancy, the reward positivity decreased with increasing hit frequency and was larger after unsuccessful trials. The effect of hit frequency was more pronounced following successful trials. These results indicate a fast trial-by-trial adaptation of expectation. The results confirm predictions of reinforcement learning theory and extend previous findings on reward magnitude to the area of complex, goal directed skill acquisition.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Motor learning encompasses a wide range of phenomena, ranging from relatively low-level mechanisms for maintaining calibration of our movements, to making high-level cognitive decisions about how to act in a novel situation. We survey the major existing approaches to characterizing motor learning at both the behavioral and neural level. In particular, we critically review two long-standing paradigms used in motor learning research?adaptation and sequence learning. We discuss the extent to which these paradigms can be considered models of motor skill acquisition, defined as the incremental improvement in our ability to rapidly select and then precisely execute appropriate actions, and conclude that they fall short of doing so. We then discuss two classes of emerging research paradigms?learning of arbitrary visuomotor mappings de novo and learning to execute movements with improved acuity?that more effectively address the acquisition of motor skill. Future work will be needed to determine the degree to which laboratory-based studies of skill, as described in this review, will relate to true expertise, which is likely dependent on the effects of practice on multiple cognitive processes that go beyond traditional sensorimotor neural architecture. ? 2019 American Physiological Society.

	abstract = {Reaching movements are comprised of the coordinated action across multiple joints. The human skeleton is redundant for this task because different joint configurations can lead to the same endpoint in space. How do people learn to use combinations of joints that maximize success in goal-directed motor tasks? To answer this question, we used a 3-degree-of-freedom manipulandum to measure shoulder, elbow and wrist joint movements during reaching in a plane. We tested whether a shift in the relative contribution of the wrist and elbow joints to a reaching movement could be learned by an implicit reinforcement regime. Unknown to the participants, we decreased the task success for certain joint configurations (wrist flexion or extension, respectively) by adding random variability to the endpoint feedback. In return, the opposite wrist postures were rewarded in the two experimental groups (flexion and extension group). We found that the joint configuration slowly shifted towards movements that provided more control over the endpoint and hence higher task success. While the overall learning was significant, only the group that was guided to extend the wrist joint more during the movement showed substantial learning. Importantly, all changes in movement pattern occurred independent of conscious awareness of the experimental manipulation. These findings suggest that the motor system is generally sensitive to its output variability and can optimize joint-space solutions that minimize task-relevant output variability. We discuss biomechanical biases (e.g. joint’s range of movement) that could impose hurdles to the learning process.},

While this results in rapid adaptation, improvements quickly disappear. This study tested the hypothesis that a reinforcement learning approach improves retention and transfer of a new gait pattern. The results of a pilot study and larger experiment are presented. Healthy subjects were randomly assigned to either a supervised group, who received explicit instructions and directional error feedback while they learned a new gait pattern on a treadmill, or a reinforcement group, who was only shown whether they were close to or far from the desired gait. Subjects practiced for 10 min, followed by immediate and overnight retention and over-ground transfer tests. The pilot study showed that subjects could learn a new gait pattern under a reinforcement learning paradigm. The larger experiment, which had twice as many subjects (16 in each group) showed that the reinforcement group had better overnight retention than the supervised group (a 32\% vs. 120\% error increase, respectively), but there were no differences for over-ground transfer. These results suggest that encouraging participants to find rewarding actions through self-guided exploration is beneficial for retention.},

	abstract = {From typing on a keyboard to playing the piano, many everyday skills require the ability to quickly and accurately perform sequential movements. It is well known that the availability of rewards leads to increases in motivational vigor whereby people enhance both the speed and force of their movements. However, in the context of motor skills, it is unclear whether rewards also lead to more effective motor planning and action selection. Here, we trained human participants to perform four separate sequences in a skilled motor sequencing task. Two of these sequences were trained explicitly and performed with precues that allow for the planning of movements, while the other two were trained implicitly. Immediately following the introduction of performance-contingent monetary incentives, participants improved their performance on all sequences consistent with enhancements in motivational vigor. However, there was a much larger performance boost for explicitly trained sequences. We replicated these results in a second, preregistered experiment with an independent sample. We conclude from these experiments that rewards enhance both the planning of movements as well as motivational vigor.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Offering people rewards and incentives typically improves their performance on skilled motor tasks. However, the mechanisms by which motivation impacts motor skills remains unclear. In two experiments, we show that motivation impacts motor sequencing skills in two separate ways. First, the prospect of reward speeds up the execution of all actions. Second, rewards provide an additional boost to motor planning when explicit skill knowledge can be used to prepare movements in advance.},

One argument is based on the idea that an observed effect size may increase in impact when generalized to a new context because of processes of accumulation over time or application to large populations. However, the field is now in danger of heuristically accepting all effects as potentially important. We aim to encourage researchers to think thoroughly about the various mechanisms that may both amplify and counteract the importance of an observed effect size. Researchers should draw on the multiple amplifying and counteracting mechanisms that are likely to simultaneously apply to the effect when that effect is being generalized to a new and likely more dynamic context. In this way, researchers should aim to transparently provide verifiable lines of reasoning to justify their claims about an effect?s importance or unimportance. This transparency can help move psychological science toward a more rigorous assessment of when psychological findings matter for the contexts that researchers want to generalize to.},

	abstract = {Background and objective The effects of motor learning, such as motor adaptation, in stroke rehabilitation are often transient, thus mandating approaches that enhance the amount of learning and retention. Previously, we showed in young individuals that reward and punishment feedback have dissociable effects on motor adaptation, with punishment improving adaptation and reward enhancing retention. If these findings were able to generalise to patients with stroke, they would provide a way to optimise motor learning in these patients. Therefore, we tested this in 45 patients with chronic stroke allocated in three groups.
Methods Patients performed reaching movements with their paretic arm with a robotic manipulandum. After training (day 1), day 2 involved adaptation to a novel force field. During the adaptation phase, patients received performance-based feedback according to the group they were allocated: reward, punishment or no feedback (neutral). On day 3, patients readapted to the force field but all groups now received neutral feedback.
Results All patients adapted, with reward and punishment groups displaying greater adaptation and readaptation than the neutral group, irrespective of demographic, cognitive or functional differences. Remarkably, the reward and punishment groups adapted to similar degree as healthy controls. Finally, the reward group showed greater retention.
Conclusions This study provides, for the first time, evidence that reward and punishment can enhance motor adaptation in patients with stroke. Further research on reinforcement-based motor learning regimes is warranted to translate these promising results into clinical practice and improve motor rehabilitation outcomes in patients with stroke.},

The aim of this investigation was to use a 3D kinematic data set collected on highly-skilled skiers during slalom race simulations to quantify ski motion characteristics and to compare these measures with theoretical predictions based primarily on ski geometrical characteristics. For slalom turns on moderate steepness (19°), ski edging angles reached maximum values of 65.7 ± 1.7° and 71.0 ± 1.9° for 10 and 13 m gate spacings. Turn radii reached minimum values of 3.96 ± 0.23 and 4.94 ± 0.59 m for the 10 and 13 m courses. These values were in good agreement with theoretical predictions by Howe (2001) of turn radius based on edging angle. Other results of the study support recent developments in understanding of the role which the ski shovel plays in groove formation during carving, and also point to the need for further study of how ski geometrical and physical characteristics interact to determine the ski's trajectory, particularly at low edge angles. These results have important implications for understanding the consequences that ski design can have for skier technique and tactics in competitive slalom skiing.},

Free throws success was recorded before training (PreT), immediately after (Postd0), one day later (Postd1), and seven days later (Postd7). The error-based group, but not the reinforcement group, showed a significant immediate improvement in free throw accuracy (PreT vs Postd0). Interestingly, over time (Postd0 vs Postd1 vs Postd7), the reinforcement group significantly improved its accuracy, while the error-based group decreased it, returning to the PreT level (PreT vs Post7). The mixed group showed the advantage of both training methods, i.e., fast acquisition and retention on a long-term scale. Error-based learning leads to better acquisition, while reinforcement learning leads to better retention. Therefore, the combination of both types of learning is more efficient for both acquisition and retention processes.

	abstract = {Learning new motor behaviors or adjusting previously learned actions to account for dynamic changes in our environment requires the operation of multiple distinct motor learning processes, which rely on different neuronal substrates. For instance, humans are capable of acquiring new motor patterns via the formation of internal model representations of the movement dynamics and through positive reinforcement. In this review, we will discuss how changes in human physiological markers, assessed with noninvasive brain stimulation techniques from distinct brain regions, can be utilized to provide insights toward the distinct learning processes underlying motor learning. We will summarize the findings from several behavioral and neurophysiological studies that have made efforts to understand how distinct processes contribute to and interact when learning new motor behaviors. In particular, we will extensively review two types of behavioral processes described in human sensorimotor learning: (1) a recalibration process of a previously learned movement and (2) acquiring an entirely new motor control policy, such as learning to play an instrument. The selected studies will demonstrate in-detail how distinct physiological mechanisms contributions change depending on the time course of learning and the type of behaviors being learned.},

In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward.

By using this blocking procedure, we show that the responses of dopamine neurons to conditioned stimuli was governed differentially by the occurrence of reward prediction errors rather than stimulus–reward associations alone, as was the learning of behavioural reactions. Both behavioural and neuronal learning occurred predominantly when dopamine neurons registered a reward prediction error at the time of the reward. Our data indicate that the use of analytical tests derived from formal behavioural learning theory provides a powerful approach for studying the role of single neurons in learning.},

	abstract = {The human motor system rapidly adapts to systematic perturbations but the adapted behavior seems to be forgotten equally rapidly. The reason for this forgetting is unclear, as is how to overcome it to promote long-term learning. Here we show that adapted behavior can be stabilized by a period of binary feedback about success and failure in the absence of vector error feedback. We examined the time course of decay after adaptation to a visuomotor rotation through a visual error-clamp condition—trials in which subjects received false visual feedback showing perfect directional performance, regardless of the movements they actually made. Exposure to this error-clamp following initial visuomotor adaptation led to a rapid reversion to baseline behavior. In contrast, exposure to binary feedback after initial adaptation turned the adapted state into a new baseline, to which subjects reverted after transient exposure to another visuomotor rotation. When both binary feedback and vector error were present, some subjects exhibited rapid decay to the original baseline, while others persisted in the new baseline. We propose that learning can be decomposed into two components—a fast-learning, fast-forgetting adaptation process that is sensitive to vector errors and insensitive to task success, and a second process driven by success that learns more slowly but is less susceptible to forgetting. These two learning systems may be recruited to different degrees across individuals. Understanding this competitive balance and exploiting the long-term retention properties of learning through reinforcement is likely to be essential for successful neuro-rehabilitation.},

The combination of new behavioral methods and computational methods has begun to unravel the interaction between processes related to strategic control and processes related to motor adaptation. These processes may operate on very different error signals. Strategy learning is sensitive to goal-based performance error. In contrast, adaptation is sensitive to prediction errors between the desired and actual consequences of a planned movement. The former guides what the desired movement should be, whereas the latter guides how to implement the desired movement. Whereas traditional approaches have favored serial models in which an initial strategy-based phase gives way to more automatized forms of control, it now seems that strategic and adaptive processes operate with considerable independence throughout learning, although the relative weight given the two processes will shift with changes in performance. As such, skill acquisition involves the synergistic engagement of strategic and adaptive processes.},

Reinforcement and error-based processes are essential for motor learning, with the cerebellum thought to be required only for the error-based mechanism. Here we examined learning and retention of a reaching skill under both processes. Control subjects learned similarly from reinforcement and error-based feedback, but showed much better retention under reinforcement. To apply reinforcement to cerebellar patients, we developed a closed-loop reinforcement schedule in which task difficulty was controlled based on recent performance. This schedule produced substantial learning in cerebellar patients and controls. Cerebellar patients varied in their learning under reinforcement but fully retained what was learned. In contrast, they showed complete lack of retention in error-based learning. We developed a mechanistic model of the reinforcement task and found that learning depended on a balance between exploration variability and motor noise. While the cerebellar and control groups had similar exploration variability, the patients had greater motor noise and hence learned less. Our results suggest that cerebellar damage indirectly impairs reinforcement learning by increasing motor noise, but does not interfere with the reinforcement mechanism itself. Therefore, reinforcement can be used to learn and retain novel skills, but optimal reinforcement learning requires a balance between exploration variability and motor noise.},

Exploiting these common features creates generalized knowledge that can be applied across varied circumstances. Memory instability explains many of the biological and behavioural conditions necessary for generalization and offers predictions for how generalization is produced.},

	abstract = {Summary
Although learning a motor skill, such as a tennis stroke, feels like a unitary experience, researchers who study motor control and learning break the processes involved into a number of interacting components. These components can be organized into four main groups. First, skilled performance requires the effective and efficient gathering of sensory information, such as deciding where and when to direct one's gaze around the court, and thus an important component of skill acquisition involves learning how best to extract task-relevant information. Second, the performer must learn key features of the task such as the geometry and mechanics of the tennis racket and ball, the properties of the court surface, and how the wind affects the ball's flight. Third, the player needs to set up different classes of control that include predictive and reactive control mechanisms that generate appropriate motor commands to achieve the task goals, as well as compliance control that specifies, for example, the stiffness with which the arm holds the racket. Finally, the successful performer can learn higher-level skills such as anticipating and countering the opponent's strategy and making effective decisions about shot selection. In this Primer we shall consider these components of motor learning using as an example how we learn to play tennis.},

	abstract = {People generally select a similar speed for a given motor task, such as reaching for a cup. One well established determinant of movement time is the speed–accuracy trade-off: movement time increases with the accuracy requirement. A second possible determinant is the energetic cost of making a movement. Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by generalized movement slowing (bradykinesia), provides the opportunity to directly explore this second possibility. We compared reaching movements of patients with PD with those of control subjects in a speed–accuracy trade-off task comprising conditions of increasing difficulty. Subjects completed as many trials as necessary to make 20 movements within a required speed range (trials to criterion, Nc). Difficulty was reflected in endpoint accuracy and Nc. Patients were as accurate as control subjects in all conditions (i.e., PD did not affect the speed–accuracy trade-off). However, Nc was consistently higher in patients, indicating reluctance to move fast although accuracy was not compromised. Specifically, the dependence of Nc on movement energy cost (slope SN) was steeper in patients than in control subjects. This difference in SN suggests that bradykinesia represents an implicit decision not to move fast because of a shift in the cost/benefit ratio of the energy expenditure needed to move at normal speed. SN was less steep, but statistically significant, in control subjects, which demonstrates a role for energetic cost in the normal control of movement speed. We propose that, analogous to the established role of dopamine in explicit reward-seeking behavior, the dopaminergic projection to the striatum provides a signal for implicit “motor motivation.”},

	abstract = {Making a movement may be thought of as an economic decision in which one spends effort to acquire reward. Time discounts reward, which predicts that the magnitude of reward should affect movement vigor: we should move faster, spending greater effort, when there is greater reward at stake. Indeed, saccade peak velocities are greater and reaction-times shorter when a target is paired with reward. In this study, we focused on human reaching and asked whether movement kinematics were affected by expectation of reward. Participants made out-and-back reaching movements to one of four quadrants of a 14-cm circle. During various periods of the experiment only one of the four quadrants was paired with reward, and the transition from reward to nonreward status of a quadrant occurred randomly. Our experiment design minimized dependence of reward on accuracy, granting the subjects wide latitude in self-selecting their movement speed, amplitude, and variability. When a quadrant was paired with reward, reaching movements had a shorter reaction time, higher peak velocity, and greater amplitude. Despite this greater vigor, movements toward the rewarded quadrant suffered from less variability: both reaction times and reach kinematics were less variable when there was expectation of reward. Importantly, the effect of reward on vigor was specific to the movement component that preceded the time of reward (outward reach), not the movement component that followed it (return reach). Our results suggest that expectation of reward not only increases vigor of human reaching but also decreases its variability.

NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Movements may be thought of as an economic transaction where the vigor of the movement represents the effort that the brain is willing to expend to acquire a rewarding state. We show that in reaching, reward discounts the cost of effort, producing movements with shorter reaction time, higher velocity, greater amplitude, and reduced reaction-time variability. These results complement earlier observations in saccades, suggesting a common principle of economics across modalities of motor control.},

We propose that the basal ganglia evolved from a circuit that in lower vertebrates and some mammals is sufficient to directly command simple or stereotyped movements to one that indirectly controls the vigor of goal-directed movements. The implications of a dual role of the basal ganglia in the control of vigor and response to reward are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Motor skill learning involves a practice-induced improvement in the speed and/or accuracy of a discrete movement. It is often thought that paradigms involving repetitive practice of discrete movements performed in a fixed sequence result in a further enhancement of skill beyond practice of the individual movements in a random order. Sequence-specific performance improvements could, however, arise without practice as a result of knowledge of the sequence order; knowledge could operate by either enabling advanced motor planning of the known sequence elements or by increasing overall motivation. Here, we examined how knowledge and practice contribute to performance of a sequence of movements. We found that explicit knowledge provided through instruction produced practice-independent improvements in reaction time and execution quality. These performance improvements occurred even for random elements within a partially known sequence, indicative of a general motivational effect rather than a sequence-specific effect of advanced planning. This motivational effect suggests that knowledge influences performance in a manner analogous to reward. Additionally, practice led to similar improvements in execution quality for both known and random sequences. The lack of interaction between knowledge and practice suggests that any skill acquisition occurring during discrete sequence tasks arises solely from practice of the individual movement elements, independent of their order. We conclude that performance improvements in discrete sequence tasks arise from the combination of knowledge-based motivation and sequence-independent practice; investigating this interplay between cognition and movement may facilitate a greater understanding of the acquisition of skilled behavior.},

To explore the mechanisms underlying such reward-oriented behavior, we devised a memory-guided saccade task in which only one fixed direction out of four was rewarded, which was called the one-direction-rewarded task (1DR). As the rewarded direction was changed in four blocks, saccades in a given direction were rewarded in one block (constituting reward-oriented behavior), but non-rewarded in the other blocks (non-reward-oriented behavior). As a control, an all-directions-rewarded task (ADR) was used. Using these tasks, we found that the parameters of saccades changed depending on whether or not the saccade was followed by reward. (1) The mean saccadic peak velocity was higher and the mean saccade latency was shorter in the rewarded condition than in the non-rewarded condition. (2) The mean saccade amplitude showed no difference in two out of three monkeys. (3) The variations of saccadic velocity, latency and amplitude were smaller in the rewarded condition. (4) Within a block of 1DR, the saccade velocity remained high in the rewarded condition, but decreased gradually in the non-rewarded condition; it decreased only slightly in ADR. The saccade latency showed the opposite pattern of change, but less clearly. (5) The saccades in the non-rewarded condition tended to have slower velocities and longer latencies in the trials shortly after a rewarded trial. (6) The ratio of error trials was much higher in the non-rewarded condition than the rewarded condition. (7) The errors, which were due to premature or incorrect saccades, showed unique spatiotemporal patterns that would reflect the competition between the cognitive and motivational processes. These results provide important constraints to the neuronal mechanism underlying reward-oriented behavior because it must satisfy these rules.},

Mathematically, this corresponds to regressing a mapping between the set of observations and the set of actions. Recently, however, it has been shown both in cognitive and motor neuroscience that humans are not only able to learn particular stimulus-response mappings, but are also able to extract abstract structural invariants that facilitate generalization to novel tasks. Here we show how such structure learning can enhance facilitation in a sensorimotor association task performed by human subjects. Using regression and reinforcement learning models we show that the observed facilitation cannot be explained by these basic models of learning stimulus-response associations. We show, however, that the observed data can be explained by a hierarchical Bayesian model that performs structure learning. In line with previous results from cognitive tasks, this suggests that hierarchical Bayesian inference might provide a common framework to explain both the learning of specific stimulus-response associations and the learning of abstract structures that are shared by different task environments.},

Pavlov's success is based on two important advantages over tit-for-tat: it can correct occasional mistakes and exploit unconditional cooperators. This second feature prevents Pavlov populations from being undermined by unconditional cooperators, which in turn invite defectors. Pavlov seems to be more robust than tit-for-tat, suggesting that cooperative behaviour in natural situations may often be based on win-stay, lose-shift.},

	abstract = {Background
Reinforcement learning (RL) and win stay/lose shift model accounts of decision making are both widely used to describe how individuals learn about and interact with rewarding environments. Though mutually informative, these accounts are often conceptualized as independent processes and so the potential relationships between win stay/lose shift tendencies and RL parameters have not been explored.
New method
We introduce a methodology to directly relate RL parameters to behavioral strategy. Specifically, by calculating a truncated multivariate normal distribution of RL parameters given win stay/lose shift tendencies from simulating these tendencies across the parameter space, we maximize the normal distribution for a given set of win stay/lose shift tendencies to approximate reinforcement learning parameters.
Results
We demonstrate novel relationships between win stay/lose shift tendencies and RL parameters that challenge conventional interpretations of lose shift as a metric of loss sensitivity. Further, we demonstrate in both simulated and empirical data that this method of parameter approximation yields reliable parameter recovery.
Comparison with existing method
We compare this method against the conventionally used maximum likelihood estimation method for parameter approximation in simulated noisy and empirical data. For simulated noisy data, we show that this method performs similarly to maximum likelihood estimation. For empirical data, however, this method provides a more reliable approximation of reinforcement learning parameters than maximum likelihood estimation.
Conclusions
We demonstrate the existence of relationships between win stay/lose shift tendencies and RL parameters and introduce a method that leverages these relationships to enable recovery of RL parameters exclusively from win stay/lose shift tendencies.},

	abstract = {W.K. Estes often championed an approach to model development whereby an existing model was augmented by the addition of one or more free parameters to account for additional psychological mechanisms. Following this same approach we utilized Estes’ (1950) own augmented learning equations to improve the plausibility of a win-stay-lose-shift (WSLS) model that we have used in much of our recent work. We also improved the plausibility of a basic reinforcement-learning (RL) model by augmenting its assumptions. Estes also championed models that assumed a comparison between multiple concurrent cognitive processes. In line with this, we develop a WSLS–RL model that assumes that people have tendencies to stay with the same option or switch to a different option following trials with relatively good (“win”) or bad (“lose”) outcomes, and that the tendencies to stay or shift are adjusted based on the relative expected value of each option. Comparisons of simulations of the WSLS–RL model with data from three different decision-making experiments suggest that the WSLS–RL provides a good account of decision-making behavior. Our results also support the assertion that human participants weigh both the overall valence of the previous trial’s outcome and the relative value of each option during decision-making.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Motor learning has been modeled as an implicit process in which an error, signaling the difference between the predicted and actual outcome is used to modify a model of the actor-environment interaction. This process is assumed to operate automatically and implicitly. However, people can employ cognitive strategies to improve performance. It has recently been shown that when implicit and explicit processes are put in opposition, the operation of motor learning mechanisms will offset the advantages conferred by a strategy and eventually, performance deteriorates. We present a computational model of the interplay of these processes. A key insight of the model is that implicit and explicit learning mechanisms operate on different error signals. Consistent with previous models of sensorimotor adaptation, implicit learning is driven by an error reflecting the difference between the predicted and actual feedback for that movement. In contrast, explicit learning is driven by an error based on the difference between the feedback and target location of the movement, a signal that directly reflects task performance. Empirically, we demonstrate constraints on these two error signals. Taken together, the modeling and empirical results suggest that the benefits of a cognitive strategy may lie hidden in many motor learning tasks.},

	abstract = {When we learn a new skill (e.g., golf) without a coach, we are ?active learners?: we have to choose the specific components of the task on which to train (e.g., iron, driver, putter, etc.). What guides our selection of the training sequence? How do choices that people make compare with choices made by machine learning algorithms that attempt to optimize performance? We asked subjects to learn the novel dynamics of a robotic tool while moving it in four directions. They were instructed to choose their practice directions to maximize their performance in subsequent tests. We found that their choices were strongly influenced by motor errors: subjects tended to immediately repeat an action if that action had produced a large error. This strategy was correlated with better performance on test trials. However, even when participants performed perfectly on a movement, they did not avoid repeating that movement. The probability of repeating an action did not drop below chance even when no errors were observed. This behavior led to suboptimal performance. It also violated a strong prediction of current machine learning algorithms, which solve the active learning problem by choosing a training sequence that will maximally reduce the learner's uncertainty about the task. While we show that these algorithms do not provide an adequate description of human behavior, our results suggest ways to improve human motor learning by helping people choose an optimal training sequence.},
